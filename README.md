#TeenAid
## Inspiration
My inspiration for this app came from the lack of a centralized hub that makes it convenient to address and solve the problems I was facing.
## What it does
It is an all in one tool that can help you: 
-Share your problems with an inbuilt AI chatbot
-Manage your homework and other tasks efficiently with a to do list
-Study effectively with a pomodoro timer
-Calculate your BMI and view a visualization to compare it.
-Track and view your Sleep And Water intake across a month on a bar chart
## How I built it
I developed an AI powered application using React for the frontend and Python as a backend proxy for my AI bot. The backend supports multiple options, including cloud-hosted models like Gemini or local models run via Ollama. For the UI and other aspects in my App, I used Ant Design Mobile, and Recharts for data visualization. Finally, to save user data privately, I used indexDB instead of an online database.
## Challenges I ran into
I had to learn lots of new technologies in one day and as I was working alone it wasn't very easy and lead to lots of bugs. But luckily through patience and hard work I was able to build a working, polished end product.
## Accomplishments that I am proud of
I am proud of the UI looking clean and professional as UI design is not my strong suit.  Also I am proud of how I integrated AI into my app by using a backend proxy server which allows flexibility.
## What I learned
I learned how to work under a time time limit while building a good quality product.
## What's next for TeenAid
I hope to add more features like quests and levels that will gamify the self care aspect of teens.
